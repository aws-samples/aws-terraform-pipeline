## Setup a cross-account pipeline

The pipeline can assume a cross-account role and deploy to another AWS account.

1. Ensure there is a [cross-account IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html) that can be assumed by the codebuild roles (validate and execute). 
2. Edit the provider in "your repo" to include the [assume role argument](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws/aws-assumerole).

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"
  assume_role {
    role_arn     = "arn:aws:iam::112233445566:role/cross-account-role"
    session_name = "pipeline"
  }
}
```
3. Commit the changes and run the pipeline.
