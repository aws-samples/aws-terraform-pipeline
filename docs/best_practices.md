# Best practices

The CodeBuild execution role uses the [AWSAdministratorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AdministratorAccess.html) IAM policy  as this pattern is designed for a wide audience to deploy any resource to an AWS account. It assumes there are strong organizational controls in place and good segregation practices at the AWS account level. If you need to better scope the policy, the `codebuild_policy` optional input can be used to replace this with an IAM policy of your choosing. 

Permissions to your CodeCommit repository, CodeBuild projects, and CodePipeline pipeline should be tightly controlled. Here are some ideas:
- [Specify approval permission for specific pipelines and approval actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/approvals-iam-permissions.html#approvals-iam-permissions-limited).
- [Using identity-based policies for AWS CodeBuild](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-control-iam-identity-based-access-control.html). 
- [Limit pushes and merges to branches in AWS CodeCommit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/how-to-conditional-branch.html)

Checkov skips can be used where Checkov policies conflict with your organization's practices or design decisions. The `checkov_skip` module input allows you to set skips for all resources in your repository. For example, if your organization operates in a single region you may want to add `CKV_AWS_144` (Ensure that S3 bucket has cross-region replication enabled). For individual resource skips, you can still use [inline code comments](https://www.checkov.io/2.Basics/Suppressing%20and%20Skipping%20Policies.html).
