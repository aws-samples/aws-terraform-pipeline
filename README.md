# terraform-aws-pipeline
 
Deploy terraform with terraform. 

üêì ü•ö ?

(If you want to deploy to multiple AWS accounts use [terraform-multi-account-pipeline](https://github.com/aws-samples/terraform-multi-account-pipeline))

## Prerequisites
- An existing AWS CodeCommit repository *OR* an [AWS CodeConnection connection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dtconsole/latest/userguide/welcome-connections.html) to the third-party source and repo of your choice (GitHub, Gitlab, etc)
- [Remote state](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state/remote) that the pipeline can access (using the CodeBuild IAM role)  

## Deployment

This module must be deployed to a separate repository to the code you want to push through it.

```
your repo
   modules
   backend.tf 
   main.tf
   provider.tf
   variables.tf    

pipeline repo 
   main.tf <--module deployed here
```

Segregation enables the pipeline to run commands against the code in "your repo" without affecting the pipeline infrastructure. This could be an infrastructure or bootstrap repo for the AWS account.

## Module Inputs

AWS Codecommit:
```hcl
module "pipeline" {
  source        = "aws-samples/pipeline/aws"
  version       = "2.2.x"
  pipeline_name = "pipeline-name"
  repo          = "codecommit-repo-name"
}
```
Third-party service:
```hcl
module "pipeline" {
  source        = "aws-samples/pipeline/aws"
  version       = "2.2.x"
  pipeline_name = "pipeline-name"
  repo          = "organization/repo"
  connection    = aws_codestarconnections_connection.this.arn
}
```
`pipeline_name` is used to name the pipeline and prefix other resources created, like IAM roles. 

`repo` is the name of your existing repo that the pipeline will use as a source. If you are using a third-party service, the format is "my-organization/repo"  

`connection` is the connection arn of the [connection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dtconsole/latest/userguide/welcome-connections.html) to the third-party repo. 

### Optional Inputs

```hcl
module "pipeline" {
  ...
  branch                = "main"
  mode                  = "SUPERSEDED"
  detect_changes        = false
  kms_key               = aws_kms_key.this.arn
  access_logging_bucket = aws_s3_bucket.this.id
  artifact_retention    = 90
  log_retention         = 90

  codebuild_policy  = aws_iam_policy.this.arn
  build_timeout     = 10
  terraform_version = "1.7.0"
  checkov_version   = "3.2.0"
  tflint_version    = "0.55.0"

  vpc = {
    vpc_id             = "vpc-011a22334455bb66c",
    subnets            = ["subnet-011aabbcc2233d4ef"],
    security_group_ids = ["sg-001abcd2233ee4455"],
  }
  
  tags = join(",", [
    "Environment[Dev,Prod]",
    "Source"
  ])
  tagnag_version = "0.7.9"

  checkov_skip = [
    "CKV_AWS_144", #Ensure that S3 bucket has cross-region replication enabled
  ]
}
```

See [Optional Inputs](./docs/optional_inputs.md) for descriptions. 

## Setup a cross-account pipeline
The pipeline can assume a cross-account role and deploy to another AWS account.

1. Ensure there is a [cross-account IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html) that can be assumed by the codebuild roles (validate and execute). 
2. Edit the provider in "your repo" to include the [assume role argument](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws/aws-assumerole).

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"
  assume_role {
    role_arn     = "arn:aws:iam::112233445566:role/cross-account-role"
    session_name = "pipeline"
  }
}
```
3. Commit the changes and run the pipeline.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| Failed lint or validate | Read the report or logs to discover why the code has failed, then make a new commit. |
| Failed fmt | This means your code is not formatted. Run `terraform fmt --recursive` on your code, then make a new commit. |
| Failed SAST | Read the Checkov logs (click CodeBuild Project > Reports tab) and either make the correction in code or add a skip to the module inputs. |
| Failed plan or apply stage | Read the report or logs to discover error in terraform code, then make a new commit. |
| Pipeline fails on apply with `the action failed because no branch named main was found ...` | Either nothing has been committed to the repo or the branch is incorrect (Eg using `Master` not `Main`). Either commit to the Main branch or change the module input to fix this. |

## Best Practices

The CodeBuild execution role uses the [AWSAdministratorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AdministratorAccess.html) IAM policy  as this pattern is designed for a wide audience to deploy any resource to an AWS account. It assumes there are strong organizational controls in place and good segregation practices at the AWS account level. If you need to better scope the policy, the `codebuild_policy` optional input can be used to replace this with an IAM policy of your choosing. 

Permissions to your CodeCommit repository, CodeBuild projects, and CodePipeline pipeline should be tightly controlled. Here are some ideas:
- [Specify approval permission for specific pipelines and approval actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/approvals-iam-permissions.html#approvals-iam-permissions-limited).
- [Using identity-based policies for AWS CodeBuild](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-control-iam-identity-based-access-control.html). 
- [Limit pushes and merges to branches in AWS CodeCommit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/how-to-conditional-branch.html)

Checkov skips can be used where Checkov policies conflict with your organization's practices or design decisions. The `checkov_skip` module input allows you to set skips for all resources in your repository. For example, if your organization operates in a single region you may want to add `CKV_AWS_144` (Ensure that S3 bucket has cross-region replication enabled). For individual resource skips, you can still use [inline code comments](https://www.checkov.io/2.Basics/Suppressing%20and%20Skipping%20Policies.html).
